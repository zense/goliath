# Goliath in React.js

For setting up the local environment, we need to install a few things. Lets start with node.

# 1. Install node and npm

```
sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev python-software-properties libffi-dev nodejs

```
# 2. Install all dependencies

Change the path to directory where you cloned the repo and do an npm install

```
npm install
```
or

Install yarn
```
npm install -g yarn

yarn install
```
# 3. Start a local server

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

# 4. Run the application

Open localhost:3000 in Chrome

# 5. Use storybook for debugging the UI.

```
npm run storybook
```
